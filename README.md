## Design

### Routes

The docs path is based on a context of `/docs/<language>/<branch>/<path>`. The language will default to `en` and the branch will default to `main`. The path will be the path to the markdown or image file in the repository.

### Redirects

There is a file called \_redirects where you can put in paths for your documentation as things change.

### Content

## Setup

## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```shellscript
pnpm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
pnpm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.
